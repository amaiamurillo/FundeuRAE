# Improving LLM Metalinguistic Knowledge Incorporating FundéuRAE's Recommendations through RAG
Currently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable proficiency and success in various language-related tasks. However, they still face limitations, particularly in domain-specific applications, where they often produce 'hallucinations' when handling queries that require up-to-date information or fall outside their training data. To address these challenges, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances LLMs by retrieving relevant document chunks from external knowledge sources ([Gao et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.10997)). One of the key areas where these models can be improved is in their metalinguistic knowledge. Therefore, the objective of this project is to improve LLM metalinguistics knowledge incorporating FundéuRAE’s recommendations through this technique.

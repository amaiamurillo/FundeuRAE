# Improving LLM Metalinguistic Knowledge Incorporating FundéuRAE's Recommendations through RAG
Large Language Models (LLMs) show remarkable abilities, but they still face challenges such as hallucinations and outdated knowledge. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a promising solution by integrating information from external databases to enhance their responses ([Gao et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10997)). One of the key areas where these models can be improved is in their metalinguistic knowledge. Therefore, the objective of this project is to improve LLM metalinguistics knowledge incorporating FundéuRAE’s recommendations through this technique.
